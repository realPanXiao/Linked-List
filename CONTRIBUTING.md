*How to contribute us?
It is very easy to join us, as long as you can make substantial improvement on this project, you can become one of us.
We have a regular seminar every Friday at 8:00 PM in the school, and the specific classroom will be released two days in advance.
When you first join, we'll have experienced members to help you understand how we work, and after that you'll have a quiz on programming, and after that you'll be a qualified member.
